# AIris
The Artificial Iris dataset

We provide a data generation program that simulates 128 x 128 artificial flower images according to 5 continuous parameters:

*Petal Length
*Petal Width
*Sepal Length
*Sepal Width
*Color (mixing parameter interpolating between red and magenta)

This dataset comes as supplementary material for the paper "Explaining predictions by Approximating the local Decision Boundary"
